# Advanced Anti-Cheat

### What does the plugin do?

AAC protects your server from gamebreaking hacks and unfair advantages such as:
- Kill-aura (attacks players/entities for you, huge combat advantage)
- Reach (increases reach of hacker beyond fair vanilla reach of 3 blocks)
- Fly (allows players to fly in survival, potentially at speed that will crash your server)
- Other unfair advantages that harm your legitamate playerbase

## Usage
:::caution
Advanced Anti-Cheat is user configurable, and as a result of this, is highly sensitive. Using the default configuration will result in false positives and is not recommended to be deployed in a production environment!
:::

Install AAC by dragging it into your plugin folder, and restart your server.

Edit the config YAML to configure your commands to execute at a specific violation level.

:::important
It's best practice to have a test server (even a local one if getting a hosted one isn't an option) to test your anti-cheat configuration before deploying 
:::

:::tip
Many server owners use Celebrimbor's optimized config, which costs an additional $14
