# Advanced Anti-Cheat

### What does the plugin do?

AAC protects your server from the following hacks:

## Usage

:::caution
Advanced Anti-Cheat is user configurable, and as a result of this, is highly sensitive. Using the default configuration will result in false positives and is not recommended to be deployed in a production environment!
:::


:::important
It's best practice to have a test server (even a local one if getting a hosted one isn't an option) to test your anti-cheat configuration before deploying 
:::


:::tip
Many server owners use Celebrimbor's optimized config, which costs an additional $14
