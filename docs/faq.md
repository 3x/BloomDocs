# **FAQs**

### How can I check my ping to the different servers?  
Open your terminal and run `ping [IP]`. You will then be told your ping (in milliseconds) to the server. Alternatively, you can use [this tool](https://tools.keycdn.com/ping) to check the approximate ping from multiple different locations. Below is a list of what IP to ping for each server.  
```
US (Dallas): pintail.bloom.host
US (Virginia): begonia.bloom.host
Finland: goldeneye.bloom.host
Germany: bluebill.bloom.host
```  

### What panel does Bloom use for Minecraft?  
Bloom uses a customized version of the [Pterodactyl panel](https://pterodactyl.io/). It features both a light and dark mode, though you should use dark mode :)  

Light mode panel

Dark mode panel  
![oh thank goodness, thats a bit better](https://i.gyazo.com/86e499722dc09c27ef968532d3c41491.png)  

If you want to check out the panel for yourself, simply go to [mc.bloom.host](https://mc.bloom.host) and login with the demo user credentials (username `demo`, password `demo`).  

### How does Bloom's waitlist work?  
When Bloom is about to launch a new node, they will put it on a waitlist. You can either purchase a server with the waitlist location selected or order a server in an in-stock location and ask to be moved. If you decide to purchase a server with the waitlist location selected, you will not have access to a server and you will not be billed until the new node is launched. If you decide to instead purchase an in-stock server, you can ask to be moved later on. Bloom staff will move you to the new location once it is launched, you won't need to do anything. You will be given a new IP and you will once again have access to your server.
